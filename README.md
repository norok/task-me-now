# TaskMeNow

This is a simple task management application built with Angular. It allows users to create, view, and manage simple tasks.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
